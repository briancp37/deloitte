# Deloitte

## Setup Instructions

To run this Streamlit app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/briancp37/deloitte.git
   cd deloitte
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but more reliable)**
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```


3. **Install Requirements**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run Streamlit App**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```






To ensure that anyone who clones your Git repository can easily install all the requirements needed to run your Streamlit application, you should provide a clear set of instructions and a list of dependencies. Here's how to do that effectively:

### Step 1: Create a `requirements.txt` File
This file should list all Python libraries and their respective versions that your project depends on. You can manually create this file or generate it using `pip`. To generate a `requirements.txt` file that includes all the packages in your current environment, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

However, this command lists all installed packages, which might include unnecessary ones. It's often better to manually write down only the libraries your project directly uses, for example:

```plaintext
streamlit==1.10.0
pandas==1.4.1
plotly==5.5.0
matplotlib==3.5.1
```

### Step 2: Add `requirements.txt` to Your Repository
Make sure to add and commit this file to your repository. This way, anyone who clones the repo will have access to it.

```bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements file"
git push
```

### Step 3: Write Installation Instructions
In your repository, you should have a `README.md` file that includes installation instructions. Update or create this file to guide others on how to set up their environment. Hereâ€™s an example of what these instructions might look like:

```markdown
# Project Title

## Setup Instructions

To run this Streamlit app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run your_script.py
   ```

Follow these steps to set up and start the Streamlit app.
```

### Step 4: Commit the README Updates
Don't forget to commit your updated `README.md` to your Git repository:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with installation instructions"
git push
```

### Summary
By providing a `requirements.txt` and clear setup instructions in your `README.md`, you make it easy for anyone to get your Streamlit app running on their own machines with minimal hassle. This approach ensures that all dependencies are managed and that your application behaves as expected across different environments.
